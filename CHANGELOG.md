## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Planning for enhanced code fix providers for additional violation types
- Consideration for custom rule configuration options
- Future integration with additional Durable Task Framework patterns

## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-18

### Added

#### üèóÔ∏è Core Infrastructure
- **Project Structure**: Complete solution with `src/`, `tests/` organization following .NET best practices
- **Build System**: MSBuild integration with Directory.Packages.props for centralized package management
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflows for build, test, code analysis, and NuGet publishing
- **Quality Gates**: Code coverage with Codecov integration, security scanning, and multi-target testing

#### üîç Diagnostic Rules (DFA0001-DFA0010)
Complete implementation of 10 diagnostic rules for Durable Task Framework determinism:

- **DFA0001 Time APIs**: Detects non-deterministic DateTime.Now, DateTime.UtcNow, Stopwatch usage
- **DFA0002 GUID Generation**: Identifies Guid.NewGuid() calls in orchestrator functions  
- **DFA0003 Random Numbers**: Catches Random class usage and System.Random instantiation
- **DFA0004 I/O Operations**: Detects file I/O, HTTP calls, database operations in orchestrators
- **DFA0005 Environment Access**: Identifies environment variable reads and system-specific calls
- **DFA0006 Static State**: Detects access to static fields, properties, and mutable static data
- **DFA0007 Thread Blocking**: Catches Thread.Sleep, blocking synchronization primitives
- **DFA0008 Non-durable Async**: Identifies Task.Run, async operations not using orchestration context
- **DFA0009 Threading APIs**: Detects Thread class usage, ThreadLocal, and concurrency primitives
- **DFA0010 Azure Functions Bindings**: Azure Functions-specific binding parameter validation

#### üõ†Ô∏è Code Fix Providers
Automated code fixes for common violations:

- **DFA0001 Code Fix**: Replaces DateTime.Now with `context.CurrentUtcDateTime`, Stopwatch with durable timers
- **DFA0002 Code Fix**: Converts Guid.NewGuid() to `context.NewGuid()` 
- **DFA0007 Code Fix**: Transforms Thread.Sleep() to `await context.CreateTimer()` patterns

#### üéØ Framework Detection
- **Universal Orchestrator Detection**: Enhanced detection supporting both Azure Functions (`[OrchestrationTrigger]`) and core DTF (`TaskOrchestrationContext` parameters)
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Intelligent orchestrator method identification across different DTF hosting models
- **Activity Function Filtering**: Correctly excludes activity functions from orchestrator-specific rules

#### üìã Comprehensive Testing
- **Unit Tests**: 100+ test cases covering all diagnostic rules with NUnit test framework
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end orchestrator detection validation
- **Code Fix Tests**: Automated testing of syntax tree transformations and fix providers
- **Performance Validation**: Large-scale testing on 105-file mock codebase (4,746 violations in 4.3 seconds)

#### üì¶ NuGet Package
- **Analyzer Integration**: Automatic installation as Roslyn analyzer in consuming projects
- **Metadata**: Rich package description, tags, and documentation links
- **Versioning**: Semantic versioning with assembly and file version synchronization
- **Distribution**: Published to both NuGet.org and GitHub Packages

#### üìñ Documentation
- **Comprehensive README**: Installation guide, rules reference, configuration options
- **Sample Projects**: Working examples for both Azure Functions and DTF Core implementations  
- **Rule Documentation**: Detailed explanations with code examples and Microsoft Learn references
- **Performance Report**: Analysis of analyzer performance characteristics and scalability

#### üöÄ Performance Characteristics
- **Analysis Speed**: 1,105 violations per second, 24.45 files per second
- **Scalability**: Sub-5-second analysis for typical projects, suitable for real-time IDE integration
- **CI/CD Ready**: Minimal build time impact, validated for continuous integration scenarios
