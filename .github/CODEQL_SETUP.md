# Security Scanning Setup

This repository uses a **hybrid security approach** combining GitHub's default CodeQL setup with custom dependency security scanning.

## Current Configuration

### ‚úÖ **Default CodeQL Setup (Automatic)**
- GitHub automatically scans the code for security vulnerabilities
- No configuration required - works out of the box
- Provides comprehensive code analysis for C# projects
- Runs on pushes and pull requests automatically

### ‚úÖ **Custom Dependency Security (Workflow)**
- `.github/workflows/security.yml` handles dependency security
- **Dependency Review**: Scans for vulnerable dependencies in PRs
- **.NET Security Audit**: Lists vulnerable and deprecated packages
- Runs weekly and on code changes

## Why This Approach?

### **Benefits:**
- üîí **No Configuration Conflicts** - Default CodeQL and custom workflows work together
- üöÄ **Zero Maintenance** - Default setup updates automatically
- üîç **Comprehensive Coverage** - Code analysis + dependency security
- ‚ö° **Fast Setup** - No manual repository configuration needed

### **Coverage:**
- **Code Security**: Handled by default CodeQL (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- **Dependency Security**: Handled by custom workflow (vulnerable packages)
- **Supply Chain Security**: Dependency review on pull requests

## Previous Configuration (Deprecated)

We previously used an advanced CodeQL configuration but removed it to avoid conflicts with GitHub's default setup. The default setup provides equivalent security coverage with better maintenance.

## Troubleshooting

### ‚úÖ **No More "Advanced Configuration" Errors**
The workflow has been updated to focus only on dependency security, eliminating CodeQL configuration conflicts.

### **Want Enhanced Code Scanning?**
If you need custom CodeQL queries:
1. Disable default CodeQL in repository settings
2. Add a custom CodeQL workflow with advanced configuration
3. Trade-off: More maintenance but more control
