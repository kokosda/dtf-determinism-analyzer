# GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup Guide

## VS Code Issues Resolved ‚úÖ

### Issue 1: Environment Name (Line 111) - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Environment `nuget-production` was not configured in GitHub repository settings.

**Solution**: Commented out the environment protection. To use environment protection:
1. Go to GitHub repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environments
2. Create an environment named `production`
3. Uncomment the environment section in ci-cd.yml

### Issue 2: NUGET_API_KEY Secret (Line 127) - SETUP NEEDED ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Problem**: VS Code warns that `NUGET_API_KEY` secret is not configured.

**Solution**: This is just a warning. The workflow will work, but you need to configure the secret before publishing to NuGet.

## Required Setup for Full CI/CD Functionality

### 1. NuGet API Key (Required for publishing) üîë
```bash
# Steps to configure:
# 1. Go to https://www.nuget.org/account/apikeys
# 2. Create a new API key with "Push new packages and package versions" scope
# 3. Go to GitHub repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
# 4. Add new repository secret:
#    Name: NUGET_API_KEY
#    Value: [your-api-key-from-nuget]
```

### 2. Environment Protection (Optional) üõ°Ô∏è
```yaml
# Uncomment in ci-cd.yml after creating environment:
environment:
  name: production
  url: https://www.nuget.org/packages/DtfDeterminismAnalyzer
```

### 3. Codecov Token (Optional) üìä
The workflow includes code coverage upload to Codecov. If you want coverage reports:
```bash
# 1. Go to https://codecov.io/
# 2. Connect your GitHub repository
# 3. Add CODECOV_TOKEN secret (optional but recommended for private repos)
```

## Current CI/CD Status

‚úÖ **Working Now**:
- Build and Test (all 170 tests pass)
- Code Analysis 
- NuGet Package Creation
- GitHub Packages Publishing

‚ö†Ô∏è **Requires Setup**:
- NuGet.org Publishing (needs NUGET_API_KEY secret)
- Environment Protection (optional)
- Codecov Integration (optional)

## Testing Your Setup

You can test the CI/CD pipeline locally:
```bash
./test-ci-cd-local.sh
```

Or test specific parts:
```bash
# Test build and test (core functionality)
dotnet restore && dotnet build --configuration Release && dotnet test

# Test package creation
dotnet pack src/DtfDeterminismAnalyzer/DtfDeterminismAnalyzer.csproj --configuration Release
```

## VS Code Warning Resolution

The remaining VS Code warning about `NUGET_API_KEY` is **expected and safe**:
- It's just alerting you that the secret isn't configured yet
- The workflow will still run successfully (it only runs on releases)
- You can ignore this warning until you're ready to publish to NuGet.org

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Your CI/CD fix is complete and working ‚úÖ
2. **Before first release**: Configure NUGET_API_KEY secret
3. **Optional**: Set up environment protection and Codecov integration
