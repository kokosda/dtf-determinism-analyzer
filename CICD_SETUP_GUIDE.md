# GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup Guide

## VS Code Issues Resolved ✅

### Issue 1: Environment Name (Line 111) - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Environment `nuget-production` was not configured in GitHub repository settings.

**Solution**: Commented out the environment protection. To use environment protection:
1. Go to GitHub repo → Settings → Environments
2. Create an environment named `production`
3. Uncomment the environment section in ci-cd.yml

### Issue 2: NUGET_API_KEY Secret - MIGRATED TO TRUSTED PUBLISHERS ✅
**Previous Problem**: Required API key secret configuration.

**New Solution**: **Migrated to Trusted Publishers** - No API key needed! Uses secure OIDC tokens instead.

## Required Setup for Full CI/CD Functionality

### 1. NuGet Trusted Publishers (Recommended - More Secure) 🔐
**Modern approach using OIDC tokens instead of API keys:**
```bash
# Steps to configure Trusted Publishers:
# 1. Go to https://www.nuget.org/packages/DtfDeterminismAnalyzer/manage
# 2. Navigate to "Trusted Publishers" tab
# 3. Add new trusted publisher:
#    Owner: kokosda
#    Repository: dtf-determinism-analyzer
#    Workflow: .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
#    Environment: (leave empty or set to 'production')
# 4. No GitHub secrets needed - authentication is automatic!
```

### 1b. Alternative: NuGet API Key (Legacy approach) 🔑
**Only use if Trusted Publishers doesn't work for your setup:**
```bash
# Steps to configure (NOT RECOMMENDED - use Trusted Publishers instead):
# 1. Go to https://www.nuget.org/account/apikeys
# 2. Create API key with "Push new packages and package versions" scope
# 3. Go to GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
# 4. Add repository secret: NUGET_API_KEY
# 5. Update workflow to use --api-key ${{ secrets.NUGET_API_KEY }}
```

### 2. Environment Protection (Optional) 🛡️
```yaml
# Uncomment in ci-cd.yml after creating environment:
environment:
  name: production
  url: https://www.nuget.org/packages/DtfDeterminismAnalyzer
```

### 3. Codecov Token (Optional) 📊
The workflow includes code coverage upload to Codecov. If you want coverage reports:
```bash
# 1. Go to https://codecov.io/
# 2. Connect your GitHub repository
# 3. Add CODECOV_TOKEN secret (optional but recommended for private repos)
```

## Current CI/CD Status

✅ **Working Now**:
- Build and Test (all 170 tests pass)
- Code Analysis 
- NuGet Package Creation
- GitHub Packages Publishing

✅ **Configured with Modern Security**:
- NuGet.org Publishing (uses Trusted Publishers - no secrets needed)

⚠️ **Optional Setup**:
- Environment Protection (for extra release approval gates)
- Codecov Integration (for detailed code coverage reports)

## Testing Your Setup

You can test the CI/CD pipeline locally:
```bash
./test-ci-cd-local.sh
```

Or test specific parts:
```bash
# Test build and test (core functionality)
dotnet restore && dotnet build --configuration Release && dotnet test

# Test package creation
dotnet pack src/DtfDeterminismAnalyzer/DtfDeterminismAnalyzer.csproj --configuration Release
```

## VS Code Warning Resolution

## Summary

1. **✅ Ready to Use**: All CI/CD functionality configured with modern security
2. **🔐 Secure by Default**: Uses Trusted Publishers (OIDC tokens) instead of API keys
3. **📦 Ready for Release**: Configure Trusted Publisher on NuGet.org and you're ready to publish
4. **🛡️ Optional Security**: Add environment protection for manual release approval gates
